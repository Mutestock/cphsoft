<p> The project is created as a cli tool </p>
<p> The project is created with a poetry venv  </p>

<p> Cli command example (in this directory):</p>
<p> python ./src/main.py exercise --kek ./resources/sample01.txt ./resources/sample02.txt ./resources/sample03.txt </p>

<p> You should be able to use any three files since it's a cli tool. You could use it on your own samples if one was so inclined </p>
<p> If you don't want to use poetry (you should get comfortable with a virtual environment eventually), then make sure you have click installed </p>
<p> pip install click </p>
<p> If you're using anaconda, then click is likely already installed</p>
<p> Try it out </p>

<p> Mini Project: Text Similarity </p>
<p> DESCRIPTION </p>
<p> This project illustrates multiplication of vectors and the use of cosine similarity method for estimation the correlation between vectors.</p>
<p> Store some text in three files: </p>
<ul> 
    <li> two of the files, let's call them A and B, contain texts, created by the same author X </li>
    <li> the third text - C - is created by another author - Y.</li>
</ul>
<p>Create a program to convert the texts into vectors, to compare the vectors in pairs:</p>
<ul> 
    <li> A and B </li>
    <li> A and C </li>
    <li> B and C </li>
    <li> and to suggest the authors of each text based on the calculated similarity coefficients..</li>
</ul>
<p> You can use the provided example for directions. </p>
