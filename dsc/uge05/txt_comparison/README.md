<p> Mini Project: Text Similarity </p>
<p> DESCRIPTION </p>
<p> This project illustrates multiplication of vectors and the use of cosine similarity method for estimation the correlation between vectors.</p>
<p> Store some text in three files: </p>
<ul> 
    <li> two of the files, let's call them A and B, contain texts, created by the same author X </li>
    <li> the third text - C - is created by another author - Y.</li>
</ul>
<p>Create a program to convert the texts into vectors, to compare the vectors in pairs:</p>
<ul> 
    <li> A and B </li>
    <li> A and C </li>
    <li> B and C </li>
    <li> and to suggest the authors of each text based on the calculated similarity coefficients..</li>
</ul>
<p> You can use the provided example for directions. </p>
