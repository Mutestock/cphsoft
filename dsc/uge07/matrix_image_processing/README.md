 
<p>This project has been created as a CLI tool.

<p>If you use Anaconda then you might be able to skip using a virtual environment for this 
</p><p>exercise, since the click, pillow and numpy packages are all included, afaik. Getting 
</p><p>comfortable with a virtual environment at some point is recommended though.

<p>____ Virtual Environment stuff ____
</p>
<p>It uses the virtual environment and package manager Poetry:

</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>You can use venv instead, if you also use command below this link.

</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>pip install -r requirements.txt
</p>
<p>Note: I can't promise that installing the requirements won't make package conflicts if you 
</p><p>don't use a virtual environment
