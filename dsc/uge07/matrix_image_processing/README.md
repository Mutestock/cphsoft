This project has been created as a CLI tool.


If you use Anaconda then you might be able to skip using a virtual environment for this exercise, since the click, pillow and numpy packages are all included, afaik. Getting comfortable with a virtual environment at some point is recommended though.


____ Virtual Environment stuff ____

https://python-poetry.org/

You can use venv instead, if you also use command below this link.
https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html

pip install -r requirements.txt
Note: I can't promise that installing the requirements won't make package conflicts if you don't use a virtual environment
___

I've created a lot of different options to play around with. Mostly for funsies.
Check out cli.py if you're interested
