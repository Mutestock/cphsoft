docker-compose up

That should be all. Make sure none of your other processes uses port 13337 Otherwise change it in docker-compose.yml and .env

Primary crates(comparable to packages):

This project uses the asynchronous run time called Tokio. 

Instead of an ORM framework (Usually Diesel in Rust), this particular project uses SQLx. 

SQLx is a crate which provides asynchronous compile-time checked queries. 

Lastly, the project uses Warp, which is an asynchronous web server framework (equivalent of flask in python).

About how the assignment has been solved:
<br><br>

<h4> Conceptual level implementation </h4>


Create an SQL-script for a PostgreSQL™database that creates the tables accordingly. Bevare that the script should be reentrant:

The database creation sql script is split into many separate migratino scripts.
See ./migrations

<br><br>

Create an SQL-script with sample data for your tables. You should haveatleasttwo vetenarians, twenty pets of various kinds including some that areneither cats nor dogs, and ten caretakers some with common pets. Also this script should be reentrant:

The database itself is created during the docker container's setup
See ./docker-compose.yml

The script for populating the database with sample data can be found in ./src/misc/pop.sql
(Granted I'd much rather just call the functions I've created ...)

<br><br>

<h4> External level implementation </h4>

Create views and/or stored procedures to deal with the chosen inheritance strategy

I've taken the liberty to do neither and instead use the INHERITS keyword... Because that's what it's there for..
https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/tutorial-inheritance.html
See cat / dog migration scripts.

It should be possible to:
•See cats and dogs as separate views
•See all pets as in the single table strategy
•Update cats and dogs with a single SQL call, stored procedure or update on a view with a trigger.

<h3> --- Mindset(for me) --- </h3>


<h6>

There will be multiple implementations of each entity.

The scripts in cat / dog will create the descriminators

Rust can't create inheritance for us. This is fine.

Postgres views must be implemented. Access must be restricted. This would be complicated for an ORM framework to handle. SQLx will be used for custom sql scripts.

Need pop script with these characterica:

2 cities
2 vets
10 general pets
5 dogs
5 cats
10 caretakers



Ideas: project will use docker-compose to initialize both rust and Postgres.

Postgres first (wait for it) -\> Rust migrations gets started.

<br><br>

Two migration tactics: 

    1. function call in main function 
    
    2. SQLx cli commands in docker file.

Complication: 

    SQLx macros somehow checks for database coherence. 
    This would be cool, if it wasn't because it stops the program from compiling if the table doesn't exist. 
    However, we're reliant on the SQLx function to be called in the main method.

    In other words: We can't execute the code, because we don't have the tables in the database,
    because we can't execute the code, because we don't have the tables in the database,
    because ... etc...
    So that's fucking annoying.

    Migration tactic 1 therefore requires an alternative to the query! macros. 
    Possibly execution of an .sql file?

Constraint: 

    I am the only one using Rust.

    The entire setup must be able to be created automatically by everyone with ONLY docker-compose.

    Portability. I can't expect that the client(or reviewer) will install all the dependencies related to the project. Especially because of Rust.
