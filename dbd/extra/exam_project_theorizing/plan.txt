This project needs to use several different database paradigms.
This project can use different programming languages.


Thoughts:

Different languages have different support for the specific database paradigms.
No language except Java will have proper support for hbase
I am likely to skip Java all together.
This won't create many issues, since HBase, and probably also Cassandra,
would be too overkill for whatever project I can manage to create in this timespan.

Programming languages I am willing to use:

Rust.
Python.
Typescript.

Database paradigms I am comfortable in using:

Relational (Postgres)
Key/value (Redis)
Document (Mongo)

Database paradigms I can probably use as well:

Column-wide (Cassandra)
Graph (Dgraph)



Possible functions of each programming language:

Rust:
I have a setup for Postgres, Redis, as well as ORM and Rest in general.

Python:
Web scraping. Mongo.

Typescript:
Website visualization. Possibly Dgraph.






Additional / Personal requirements:

Solution must be containerized
